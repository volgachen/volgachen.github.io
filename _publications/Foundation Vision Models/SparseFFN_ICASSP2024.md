  In this paper, we find that the high-dimensional feed-forward networks occupies much computation cost in vision transformers. To this end, we introduce a lightweight, plug-and-play substitute, SparseFFN, that can reduce complexity in both channel and spatial dimension. SparseFFN can effectively reduce model complexity in a broad spectrum of vision models.
