#   This paper is an early work to introduce Masked Image Modeling in self-supervised learning. MST utilizes self-attention map to mask background image tokens, and supervises with a pixel-level restoration loss to preserve fine-grained information, in addition to common contrastive learning. MST helps a lot in downstream tasks.
