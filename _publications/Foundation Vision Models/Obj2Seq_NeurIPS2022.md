  We propose a general definition that encompasses a wide range of visual tasks, so that all their outputs can be decoded in an identical way: treating objects as fundamental units and generating multiple sequences based on the input image and class prompts. According to this, we build a language-guided general vision model that can meet diverse task requirements and achieve comparable performance with specialized models.
