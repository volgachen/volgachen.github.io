  The fixed-size patch embedding in current vision transformers might overlook local spatial structures and extract inferior image features. To address this problem, we propose a new module (DePatch) which learns to adaptively split the images into patches with different positions and scales in a data-driven way, resulting in an enhanced backbone to extract more potent image features.
